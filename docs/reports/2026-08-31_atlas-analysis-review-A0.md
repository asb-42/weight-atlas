# Review: alesha-pro/atlas analysis (GLM 5.3 Flash, standing in for MiMo)

- **Reviewer:** Quinn (Agent Zero, A0) — seat: review
- **Date:** 2026-08-31
- **Document under review:** `docs/2026-08-31_atlas-alesha-pro-analysis.md`
  (analysis of alesha-pro/atlas, MIT, and adoption proposal for weight-atlas)
- **Method:** cloned alesha-pro/atlas (shallow) and checked every code-level
  claim against the source; ran weight-atlas `map_name()` on real tensor names
  from the shipped 27B scan; cross-checked sizes against the research mesh.

*Disposition 2026-08-31 (weight-atlas side): F-1 accepted in full — the
"already covered" claim was false and exposed a real mapping gap; P0
implemented the same day (spec rules + fallback + 1199-name fixture +
audit tests, in_slots 63.6 % → 99.7 %). F-2 applied to the doc; F-3
applied; ml_dtypes hint folded into P1.4. Review header note added to
the analysis doc.*

## Verdict

The report is factually accurate on the external tool at an unusually high
standard — **every code-level claim I checked verified exactly**. The
adoption priorities (P1 metrics, P2 UI, P3 live probes; architecture not
ported) are sound. One major correction: the central "already covered"
claim is **false**, and it hides a real mapping gap in weight-atlas itself
for the exact model family the report targets (F-1). One minor size error
(F-2), one nit (F-3), one implementation hint (ml_dtypes).

## F-1 (major): "already covered by our `_HF_HYBRID_RULES` / `ssm_*` slots" is false

§6 claimed their GDN patterns (`in_proj_a/b/z`, `conv1d`, `dt_bias|A_log`)
are already covered by our hybrid rules; §7 P3.9 repeated "weight-side
naming is done". Empirical test — the **real names from the shipped
Qwen3.8-27B scan** (same family as the Flash-Next target) through
weight-atlas `map_name()`:

```
(0, 'other') <- model.language_model.layers.0.linear_attn.in_proj_a.weight
(0, 'other') <- model.language_model.layers.0.linear_attn.in_proj_b.weight
(0, 'other') <- model.language_model.layers.0.linear_attn.in_proj_qkv.weight
(0, 'other') <- model.language_model.layers.0.linear_attn.in_proj_z.weight
(0, 'other') <- model.language_model.layers.0.linear_attn.conv1d.weight
(0, 'other') <- model.language_model.layers.0.linear_attn.dt_bias
(0, 'other') <- model.language_model.layers.0.linear_attn.A_log
(1, 'attn_q') <- model.language_model.layers.1.self_attn.q_proj.weight
```

Our `_HF_HYBRID_RULES` matched `ssm.*` naming (Qwen3-Next Mamba branch) and
the Kimi rules covered `conv1d`/`A_log`/`dt` only under `self_attn.*` —
**not** `linear_attn.*`. **432 of 1199 shipped records (36 %) carry this
naming** and would land on `other` in any weight-atlas scan of this family.

The irony is sharp: §6 warned that *their* scanner would misfile DeepSeek
MLA/Kimi tensors, while missing that *ours* misfiles the very family it
targets.

**Proposed addition to the adoption proposal — P0 (blocks P3.9):**

1. Add HF rules mapping the Qwen3.8-family GDN naming:
   `linear_attn\.conv1d → ssm_conv1d`, `linear_attn\.dt_bias → ssm_dt`,
   `linear_attn\.A_log → ssm_a` (slots already exist);
   `linear_attn\.in_proj_(qkv|z|a|b)` need 3–4 new slots (additive spec
   change) — slot-naming decision belongs to MiMo.
2. Adopt the shipped `atlas.jsonl` (1199 real names, 432 linear-attention)
   as a **ready-made mapping-coverage fixture** for `test_name_map.py`.

**Resolution:** implemented 2026-08-31, slot naming decided as
`ssm_in_qkv`/`ssm_in_z`/`ssm_in_b`/`ssm_in_a` (consistent with the existing
`ssm_*` taxonomy); fixture + audit tests in `tests/test_name_audit.py`
and `tests/fixtures/names_qwen38_27b_hf.json`. Additionally surfaced:
`mtp.layers.N.*` collides with main-stack layer indices (15 tensors,
documented + pinned, unfixed — needs an MTP slot design).

## F-2 (minor): "51B Qwen3.8 target" misreads the size

Research mesh: Flash-Next = 125B main + 51B n-gram embeddings (≈176B total),
6B active. The report's I/O estimate (~200 GB per SQNR format) matched
51B×4B fp32 — the full checkpoint is ≈700 GB per pass. This strengthens the
report's own opt-in/gating recommendation, and suggests an additional lever:
seeded per-tensor subsampling (deterministic) for SQNR on giant tensors
instead of full fp32 materialization. **Resolution:** doc updated (P1.4).

## F-3 (nit): TypeScript LOC ≈4,600 → measured 4,330

Within the report's "≈"; applied anyway.

## Implementation hint for P1.4 (FP8 encoder)

NumPy has no fp8 dtype, but **ml_dtypes** ships `float8_e4m3fn` for NumPy —
replaces the planned ~25-line bit-twiddling encoder with a cast, inheriting
a tested rounding table. Their scanner uses the torch hardware dtype;
ml_dtypes is the same trick on our NumPy stack. Deterministic either way.
**Resolution:** folded into P1.4.

## Ops addendum (checked during review, no contention — all read-only/CPU)

- Seed-42 replication arm: all 24 executed-order checkpoints present (12/12
  phases done); script-order leg starting (fi log present).
- gx10 resume: fi complete, hu running (96 % GPU).
